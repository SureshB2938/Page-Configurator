# Page-Configurator
This web application allows users to upload a PDF file, view thumbnail previews of each page, and select whether each page should be printed in Color or Black &amp; White.  After selection, the app displays a clear print summary showing which pages are assigned to each mode, and provides copy buttons to quickly copy the page lists.
